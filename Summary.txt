* MCIT 591 FALL 2019 FINAL PROJECT - Music Curator *

* Project Introduction

  With new songs and albums released every week, there's always a lot of music out there. The Music Curator is to help 
  you cut through the noise by finding music that suit your tastes based on what youâ€™re already interested in and your 
  immediate feedback to our recommendations. 
  
  To do this, we needed to:
  
  1) develop a JavaFX GUI that allows users to interact with the program
  
  2) integrate Spotify API to retrieve and manage Spotify data
  
  3) integrate YouTube API to preview/download the audio
  
  4) create and connect to AWS RDS (Amazon Web Services Relational Database) to store/retrieve user preference information
  
  5) build recommendation models to analyze the track/artist/album, allowing it to perform personalized recommendations
