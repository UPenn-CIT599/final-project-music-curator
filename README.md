#### Short Description:

The music recommender will be a program with a user GUI that takes in a user’s favorite musical artists/songs and provides the user with recommendations on other artists/albums/songs that they may like (including the ability to play a preview of the artist or song). It will also be able to accept user feedback on the suggestions and update recommendations based on the user’s feedback (ex: remove suggestions that the user does not like and other recommendations that are too similar to the disliked suggestion). 

#### Features:
* Search artist, artist attributes (lyrics, trivia, artist description)
* “Artists you may like” recommendation list
* “Albums you may like” recommendation list
* Song/artist audio preview/download (30 seconds)
* User feedback for the recommendations (like/dislike)
* Updates recommendation list based on user feedback
* Removes suggestions they don’t like and any other artists who are too similar
If a user likes a suggestion, the recommendation list will update with more artists similar to the liked suggestion
